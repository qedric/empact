# ZebraFramework

This is the official README for ZebraFramework, providing a foundation for diverse vaultraising models.

## Mission

Our mission is to empower organisations, communities, and individuals to raise vaults in a transparent and secure manner, and contribute to social impact initiatives through the innovative use of blockchain technology.

## Project Overview

ZebraFramework provides a white-label solution for vaultraising platforms. Vaults build on this framework feature the following characteristics:

- **Unlock Mechanism:** Each vault can be set to unlock according to parameters determined at the time of vault-creation.

- **Access to Vaults:** vaults are distributed via tokens that are NFTs based on the ERC-1155 standard; each NFT holder has a share of the corresponding vault.

- **Regenerative Finance:** Once vaults have been distributed to all token holders, any further deposits are redistributed proportionally among other vaults on the platform.

- **Dynamic Appearance:** ZebraFramework vaults are represented by dynamic NFTs that change in appearance over time as they get closer to their maturity date.

## Use Cases

ZebraFramework vaultraising platforms are versatile and can be used for various purposes, including:

1. **NGOs and Nonprofits:** NGOs can build out their own platform that empowers their donors with the transparency and confidence to give more, knowing their donation has already been allocated to the intended beneficiaries.

2. **Disaster Relief:** Instead of collecting donations via sharing Ethereum addresses on social media, ZebraFramework can be used to create vaults that have a specific cause in mind. Trustworthy aid organisations can hold vault tokens, making it easy for people worldwide to contribute knowing their vaults will go where they are intended.

3. **Personal Savings:** Parents can create a single-edition vault that unlocks on their child's 18th birthday, encouraging long-term savings.

4. **Vaultraising for Projects:** Teams or organisations can divide vaults by percentage, making it an ideal way to distribute vaults among contributors.

5. **Long-Term Savings:** Self-organised pension vaults or long-term savings initiatives can use ZebraFramework with a large number of tokens, unlocking when a specific balance is achieved. The tokens act like shares or bonds, allowing them to be bought and sold within the community. Royalties from token trading can be distributed back in to the community.

## Smart Contracts

### Main Contract - `factory.sol`

The `factory.sol` smart contract is the heart of the ZebraFramework ecosystem. It encompasses various features and functionalities for minting, managing, and interacting with ZebraFramework. Some of the contract's key features include:

- **Minting:** Authorized addresses can mint ZebraFramework using signed mint requests.

- **Customizable Fees:** The contract allows for setting fees for creating new ZebraFramework and for withdrawing vaults from them.

- **Token URI:** The contract generates on-chain metadata for each CryptoVault, providing essential information about its state.

- **ERC-1155 Compliance:** ZebraFramework are compliant with the ERC-1155 standard, making them tradable and transferable.

- **Operator Roles:** Roles such as SIGNER_ROLE and DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE are defined to control contract operations.

### Vault Contract - `vault.sol`

The `Vault.sol` contract serves as the actual vault for each vault. It is cloned with each new vault creation and is responsible for keeping track of the balance, unlocking according to the target or maturity date, and facilitating withdrawals. 


### Generator Contract - `generator.sol`

The ZebraFramework Generator Contract is designed to generate the on-chain artwork for the ZebraFramework NFTs that represent each vault. This contract can be swapped out, so that the artwork can change over time.

- **Dynamic Appearance:** ZebraFramework vault NFTs change in appearance over time, reflecting their progress towards unlocking.
